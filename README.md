## AXMLDEC Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to setup and use the tool:

1. **Clone the repository**: Use the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/ytsutano/axmldec.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: The tool requires the Boost library. Install it using the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
   ```

3. **Build the Project**: After installing the dependencies, build the project using `cmake` and `make`. Run the following commands:

   ```bash
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release . && make
   ```

4. **Run the Tool**: To use the tool, run the following command:

   ```

## Running the Server

To start the server, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

This will start the server on port 3000.

## Uploading a File

The server provides an endpoint for file upload at /upload. This endpoint accepts POST requests with a file in the form data under the key file.

You can use a tool like curl to upload a file:

```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@path_to_your_file" http://localhost:3000/upload
```

Replace path_to_your_file with the path to the file you want to upload.

After the file is uploaded, it is processed by the server. If the processing is successful, the server responds with the processed data in XML format. ```
